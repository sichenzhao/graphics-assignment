Compilation
To compile A4 program, you just need to do following command in /A4 directory
    1. premake4 gmake
    2. make
Two commands above will generate an executable file 'A4' in /A4 directory
There is no change on premake4.lua or Makefile.
Note: This command has to be done in condition that shared library is built. 
      (means that you have to run make successfully in /cs488 directory)

After generating the A4 executable file, you can just execute it by running
command: './A4 Assets/<lua file>'

I finished this assignment on lab computer /gl17

Manual
Following the assignment requirements.

I changed the "scene_lua.cpp" file so that it will add prefix "Assets/" to all
".obj" files.  So you need to run "./A4 Assets/<lua file>" under A4 directory.

I use box bound volume for mesh. It dramatically improves the rendering speed.
For macho-cows.lua, it takes more than few minutes without bound volume, but it
can be done within 20 seconds with bound volume.

By default, bound volume is turned off. If you want my code do it, please define
"BV" during compile time. For your convinience, I also compiled a bound volume
executable as "A4-bb". By which I mean, you can simply run "./A4-bb Assets/<lua file>"
in order to get a bound volume version of graphs.

Bug: 
1. percentage is displayed perfectly on my laptop but not on lab machine, it
flashes some times.
2. shadow looks odd on some meshes, and although simple-cow has shadow, macho-cow doesn't

Note: Extra features not implemented
