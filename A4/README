Compilation
Since the project code is based on A4 ray tracer, I build my project on top of 
A4 code, and didn't bother changing the executable name or directory
To compile Project program, you just need to do following command in /A4 directory
    1. premake4 gmake
    2. make
Two commands above will generate an executable file 'A4' in /A4 directory
There is no change on premake4.lua or Makefile.
Note: This command has to be done in condition that shared library is built. 
      (means that you have to run make successfully in /cs488 directory)

I finished this assignment on lab computer /gl17

Manual:

After generating the A4 executable file, you can just execute it by running
command: './A4 Assets/<lua file name>'.

Also, multiple lua file can be rendered in turn using script "runA4.sh"
e.g. './runA4.sh obj1 obj2 obj3' is running './A4 Assets/obj1.lua' first then
running the similar command for obj2 and obj3.

After running command, you can just see the corresponding png files.

Implementation:
My ten objectives are -- 
        1. Ellipsoid and Elliptic Cone primitives
        2. Texture Mapping
        3. Mirror Reflection
        4. Refraction
        5. Glossy Reflection
        6. Glossy Refraction
        7. Grid Acceleration
        8. Depth of Field
        9. Anti-aliasing using Random Jittering
        10. Final Scene

  I implemented 1/2/3/4/7/8/9/10 while 5 and 6 are not implemented.
  Bugs about implementation will be covered in Bug section below.

Additional little improvements are --
        1. Webpage organized all rendered images
        2. Little animation using multiple pngs
        3. Multithreading on ray tracing

Bug: 
        1. Refraction not working correctly for sphere/ellipsoid/elliptic cone
        2. Grid Acceleration have error for some pixels in specific area when rendering
                e.g. showing lines on mesh
        3. Depth of Field Disk Camera radius and Focal distance need to be chosen 
        very carefully inorder to see a fair effects.
